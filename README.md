Simple Shell
The simple shell project

Synopsis
This repository holds all the code necessary for our custom simple shell to run. Our shell currently handles the executions of executables found in the environmental variable PATH, with or without their full paths. Sample commands that our shell supports include ls (/bin/ls), pwd, echo, which, whereis, etc. We've also created the following builtins.
